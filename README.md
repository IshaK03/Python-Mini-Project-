Project Description:    
Taking inspiration from one of the most adored animated movies, "Kung Fu Panda", we decided to give our game a bit of the "Po" touch. In the Valley of Peace, after a session of intense training, Master Shifu decides to treat the Dragon Warrior to a bowl of dumplings, but with a twist. As many hurdles Po passes, those many dumplings he gets. Help Po earn as many dumplings as possible in this fun-filled game!
